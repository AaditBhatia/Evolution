Stage 1 (discovering fire):
We will make a hidden treasure box which will open if you answer a General Knowledge Question correctly
This box will contain the axe.
Axe will be used to cut the tree
We will give an option to cut the tree when you are in the radius of the tree.
If the option is chosen we will present qnother question. Wood will be obtained only if the question is answered correctly.
Otherwise you lose health.
We need to find stones to light the fire.
It is getting colder with time your goal in the game is to make fire before (the timer runs out) you freeze to death.
